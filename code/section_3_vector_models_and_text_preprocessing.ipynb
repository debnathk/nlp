    "### Important Definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Token:**\n",
    "- A token is a sub-unit of substance, it can be a 'word', can be a 'punctuation', also can be a sub-words. A token is often used interchangibly with 'word'.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Letters and Characters:**\n",
    "- Letters: a, A, b, B.\n",
    "- Characters: '_', '\\n'.\n",
    "- [All letters are characters, but not all characters are letters].\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Vocabulary:**\n",
    "- Collection of all the words.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Corpus:**\n",
    "- Nothing but the dataset our ML model will be trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**N-gram:**\n",
    "- N-consecutive items.\n",
    "- unigram - 'I', bigram - 'good morning', trigram - 'See you soon'.\n",
    "- Usecase - word2vec (bigrams), markov models (bigram probabilities).\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Vector:**\n",
    "- An array of scalars.\n",
    "- Usecase - in spam detection, vectors are used as working with vectors are easier than working with raw text.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Bag of Words:**\n",
    "- An unordered collection of words.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Count Vectorizer:**\n",
    "- Counting the scalers inside a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Tokenization:**\n",
    "- \"I like cats\" -> str.split() -> [\"I\", \"like\", \"cats\"]\n",
    "- Punctuation characters can be tokenized, if it enhances the result\n",
    "- Types of tokenization - word-based, character-based, sub-word based\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Stopwords:**\n",
    "- Words that don't provide any context.\n",
    "- \"and\", \"the\", \"but\".\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Stepping and lemmatization:**\n",
    "- Converting words to root words.\n",
    "- Stemming - crude, may or may not produce meaningful word.\n",
    "- Lemmatization - sophisticated, returns a meaningful root word (aka lemma).\n",
    "- Root word of a word is dependent upon its POS.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Vector Similarity:**\n",
    "- Calculating the similarity b/w two vectors and giving a similarity score as an output.\n",
    "- Application - article spinning, word replacement\n",
    "- Measures of similarity - Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, cosine similarity is more commonly used.\n",
    "- Euclidean Distance- The Euclidean distance `d` between two points `A(x₁, y₁)` and `B(x₂, y₂)` is given by the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">d = sqrt((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²)</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cosine similarity - The cosine similarity between two vectors A and B is given by the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Cosine Similarity = (A · B) / (||A|| ||B||)\n",
    "    Where:\n",
    "    - A · B is the dot product of A and B.\n",
    "    - ||A|| is the magnitude of vector A.\n",
    "    - ||B|| is the magnitude of vector B.\n",
    "    In expanded form, this can be written as:\n",
    "    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">Cosine Similarity = Σ (Aᵢ * Bᵢ) / (√(Σ Aᵢ²) * √(Σ Bᵢ²))</p>\n",
    "    Where Σ denotes the summation over the vector elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When we are ranking the similarities, after sorting them by similraity scores, the euclidean distance annd cosine similarity is somehow equivalent.\n",
    "- If we normalize vectors, the L2-norm becomes 1: Converting all the vectors into unit length, thus just comparing them based on angles b/w them, which makes the comparison simple.\n",
    "- L2-norm - Nothing but euclidean distance of a vector from origin.\n",
    "    - The L2-norm (Euclidean norm) of a vector A with n components is given by the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">||A||₂ = √(Σ Aᵢ²)</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Where:\n",
    "        - ||A||₂ represents the L2-norm of vector A.\n",
    "        - Aᵢ denotes the i-th component of vector A.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This formula calculates the square root of the sum of squares of each component of the vector, providing a measure of the vector's magnitude in Euclidean space.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**TF-IDF:**\n",
    "- To improve the count-vectorizer.\n",
    "- Popular for documnet retrieval and text mining.\n",
    "- Intuition - If a word appears many times in several documents, it basically doesn't hold much significance in analyzing those documents.\n",
    "- The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) score of a term `t` in a document `d` within a corpus is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">TF-IDF(t, d, D) = TF(t, d) × IDF(t, D)</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Where:\n",
    "        - TF(t, d) is the term frequency of term `t` in document `d`, representing the frequency of term `t` in document `d`.\n",
    "        - IDF(t, D) is the inverse document frequency of term `t` in corpus `D`, representing the logarithmically scaled inverse fraction of the documents that contain term `t` across the entire corpus `D`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - TF-IDF score is used to evaluate the importance of a term within a document relative to its frequency in the entire corpus, providing a measure of the significance of the term in the context of the document and corpus.\n",
    "- The normalized TF-IDF score of a term t in a document d within a corpus is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">TF-IDF_norm(t, d, D) = TF-IDF(t, d, D) / √(∑(TF-IDF(t', d, D)²))</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Where:\n",
    "        - TF-IDF(t, d, D) is the TF-IDF score of term t in document d within corpus D, as calculated by the TF-IDF formula.\n",
    "        - ∑ denotes the summation over all terms t' in document d.\n",
    "        - TF-IDF_norm(t, d, D) is the normalized TF-IDF score of term t in document d within corpus D.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The normalized TF-IDF score scales down the TF-IDF score of each term in a document by the Euclidean norm of the TF-IDF vector for that document, ensuring that the scores are in the range [0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Word embedding:**\n",
    "- Unlike representing words as isolated entities with frequencies, like in count vectorizing, word embedding captures the semantic relationships b/w words. \n",
    "- Words with similar meanings or contexts are closer together in the embedding space. \n",
